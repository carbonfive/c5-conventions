# Request and system specs by definition do not test specific classes/modules,
# so they are excluded from following the `describe ClassOrModule` rule.
RSpec/DescribeClass:
  Exclude:
    - "spec/requests/**/*"
    - "spec/system/**/*"

# Prefer short examples but allow some flexibility (up to 12 lines). System
# specs are excluded from this cop because they often involve many sequential
# steps, and forcing these to be shorter can make them harder to follow.
RSpec/ExampleLength:
  Max: 12 # Default is 5
  Exclude:
    - "spec/system/**/*"

# Prefer simple, single-statement examples be collapsed to 1 line like this:
# it { is_expected.to be_truthy }
RSpec/ImplicitSubject:
  EnforcedStyle: single_statement_only

# Ideal BDD is to have one `expect` per example (so that each specification can
# have corresponding documentation in the form of an `it` block), but we allow
# some flexibility (up to 3).
RSpec/MultipleExpectations:
  Max: 3 # Default is 1
